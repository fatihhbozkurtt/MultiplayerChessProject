# Multiplayer Chess Game ♟️

This is a **multiplayer chess project** developed in Unity, focusing primarily on robust multiplayer functionality and networking logic. The visual polish and art assets are kept minimal to keep the attention on gameplay mechanics and communication between players.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Implement real-time multiplayer chess using Unity
- Explore different networking solutions and technologies
- Build a solid foundation for turn-based multiplayer game logic
- Ensure smooth player synchronization and game state management

## 🔌 Networking Technology

This project uses a hybrid networking setup for learning and flexibility:

### ✅ Photon Unity Networking (PUN 2)
- Handles **real-time multiplayer communication** (e.g., match creation, player connection, RPCs)
- Provides reliable matchmaking and room-based architecture
- Ideal for quick prototyping and testing with real players

### ✅ com.unity.transport (Unity Transport Package)
- Offers **low-level transport layer networking** for advanced networking scenarios
- Focused on efficient data transmission and flexibility
- Useful for understanding custom and DOTS-compatible multiplayer architectures

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- Classic chess rules with two-player real-time gameplay
- Turn-based movement synchronized across the network
- Basic UI to show the current turn, moves, and game state
- Clean and modular architecture for future improvements

## 📱 Platform

- Target Platform: PC (Windows/macOS)
- Can be adapted for mobile platforms later (iOS/Android)

## 📌 Notes

- This project is **prototype-level** and intended for educational and portfolio purposes.
- Art assets and polish are intentionally kept minimal.
- All networking logic is built with scalability and clarity in mind.
- Feedback and suggestions are welcome 😃!
